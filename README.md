# Token Curation

TokenCuration (name TBD) is an open source attempt to enable open, peer-to-peer token swapping platforms to navigate the increasingly complex regulatory landscape of blockchain tokens and assets. The goal is an open source, collaborative space for community members to assist in classifying tokens which may or may not bear regulatory risk in certain jurisdictions

# The List

Currently, lists have been curated for:

 - [United States](US/)

# Legal

This list is provided for informational purposes only, and should not be considered legal advice. It is provided without warranty, guarantee, etc.

# Methodology

The current methodology is to consolidate public information and to  curate a list based on what can be ascertained. Specifically, information is consolidated from:
 - Public Statements from National regulators
 - Publicly available policies from regulated businesses

## Goals

The overall goal of this project is to be temporary. Ideally regulators or other industry participants would provide explicit, clear guidance on what tokens may have regulatory risk, and which tokens may not. We love projects such as [Messari](https://messari.io), and hope that one day companies such as this may provide more analysis to assist in this classification

## Audience

The intended audience of this project are platforms which enable peer-to-peer swapping of blockchain based assets. These platforms, such as [
faast](https://faa.st), or any other "DEX", in that they provide a place for peers to connect and swap tokens and other assets. Unfortunately, it appears that in providing such a platform, these projects may bear some risk. We hope that collaborative curation can provide short-term best practices while the regulatory landscape becomes more coherent.

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and encouraged! Specific types of contributions that are welcome are:

- Community members who feel a token is mis-classified, or has been looked over
- Token foundations who would like to share legal analysis about their token. Ex. Legal analysis which indicates why a token is not a security
- Recent developments or statements by regulators which may materially change any of the analysis already listed in this project

We're looking for project maintainers, so if you are interested, please reach out!

# Current Users

 - [faast](https://faa.st) uses this list to restrict certain assets from the US market
